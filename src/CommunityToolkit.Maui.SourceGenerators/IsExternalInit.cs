// <auto-generated>
//   This code file has automatically been added by the "IsExternalInit" NuGet package (https://www.nuget.org/packages/IsExternalInit).
//   Please see https://github.com/manuelroemer/IsExternalInit for more information.
//
//   IMPORTANT:
//   DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE if you are using a "packages.config" file to manage your NuGet references.
//   Consider migrating to PackageReferences instead:
//   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference
//   Migrating brings the following benefits:
//   * The "IsExternalInit" folder and the "IsExternalInit.cs" file don't appear in your project.
//   * The added file is immutable and can therefore not be modified by coincidence.
//   * Updating/Uninstalling the package will work flawlessly.
